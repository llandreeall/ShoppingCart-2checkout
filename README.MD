Hello!
I made a shopping cart using Javascript, HTML and CSS. The main functionalities are:<br>
    1. Provide a list of products available, orderedv by price, descending. Each product has a "Add to cart" button and the currency is set to USD by default. The informations about the products was extracted from this api: http://private-32dcc-products72.apiary-mock.com/product<br>
    2. Add products to the cart. Once added the product can be removed from the shopping card using the "Delete" button. If the "Add to cart" button is pressed multiple times then the quantity of that product in the cart increases. Also the quantity is editable by hand. Near the title of the product is an icon and when hovered it enables a pop-up with the description of the product.<br>
    3. If the user changes the currency, the prices must be converted into the selected currency. The currency selector is in the right corner. 
     I used a currency conversion library https://github.com/openexchangerates/money.js/ <br>
     
Thank you for your time!
