Hello!
I attempted to do all four tasks but I had some difficulties with the last one. If I  write in the URL "curr=EUR" or other currency
it changes the prices of the product list, it changes the value of the dropdown but it sets the products in the shopping cart to 0.
I tried to use localStorage and sessionStorage, I serialized the array of selected products, it became a string, I set an item to the
Storage with that string but when I refresh or change the currency from the URL it still doesn't save the selected products.
I tried to see if it would work if I store a simple string and it does :). But it doesn't work with my list of selected products, so
I would say the whole task works 50%. 
Observation1: As mentioned the delete button is situated on the left box and it deletes the products fron the shopping cart.  
Observation2: If pressed multiple times on the "Add to cart" button it increases the quantity of that product. I thought it may be a 
nice feature.
Thank you for your time!
